# FLEXPOD
#### TPU X ALU Wire Tripod
>By Aaron Zhan

Hello there! Thanks for stopping by!
## Introduction
I am a maker, 3D printer, inventor, and creative film-maker! 
(Though you can say those are a bit of a stretch, as I am learning new things almost every day). 
I tend to film Youtube videos with my phone, 
but I have always struggled to have a good yet simple camera/tripod setup. Mounting 
a camera is a struggle for anyone trying to take photos or videos (newbies and pros alike).
The main problem with tripods are that they aren't _flexible_ as int he sense that you can only use them in flat surfaces
and it is quite a hassle to adjust and set up (turning knobs, etc)
Luckily, the Gorilla Pod was invented. The Gorilla Pod (and other designs) feature 3 or more flexible
legs that can flex and adapt to the surface/object the tripod is to be mounted onto.
They are great products, and they are quite a hit!
However, if you are a fellew 3D printer, you would instantly have the instrusive thought of: "Can I 3D print that?"

Well, I tried that. And it went South. Some issues experienced with the Official Gorrila Pod was expereinced: 
the friction between the articulated links would gradually wear down. This would happen even whith the TPU bands around the links.
Well, there are variants of the gorilla pod where the legs are made out of 3 pieces of continuous metal that is flexible yet rigid
This design seldom loses its strength and thius its effectiveness. 
And with some inspiration from REddit, I decided to make the tripod.
## Design
So I had found a 3D printed Gorilla Pod design from My Mini Factory. It was honestly quite a clever design, taking great inspiration from the Original Gorilla Pid. It uses 3D printed segments in hard plastic (PLA, PERTG, or ABS) and used some TPU connection parts (
