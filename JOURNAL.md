## 10/23/2025 9 AM - Inspiration and Research (and material acquisition)  

![Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 9.32.09 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDc1NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ff1c591ee80d8c00f1057a806c8d19fe36b9dd62/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20at%209.32.09%E2%80%AFAM.png)
I was scrolling through reddit and I came across an inspiring post where the OP used TPU and Aluminum wire. The OP created many cool projects like tripods, helping-hands, and other cool contraptions. The process incorporated pausing the print and embedding aluminum wire in the TPU print. I am thinking of expanding on this idea:

- Create slots so that aluminum wire doesn't need to be added in the middle of a print pause
- Create useful mounts, adaptable and modular
This project seems to have died down on the internet, so I am seeking to bring it back to life!

And I also researched and bought the materials:
95A TPU (already had)
5mm diameter aluminum craft wire
I have all of these supplies, so we should be ready to go!  

## 10/23/2025 2 PM - Created first TPU leg sleeve mockup CAD

In this work session, I created the first version of the TPU leg. It is currently in a very basic form. Essentially, the TPU will form a sleeve around the Aluminum craft wire. I'm not sure if the TPU is too thick - we'll need to print it out to test it!  

## 10/23/2025 4 PM - CAD brush up and slice + first print

Made some small changes to the CAD model: added m3 mounting holes for the soon-to-be tripod. Definitely a nice print. Printed with Prusa Slicer and factory Prusa i3 mk3s+. The TPU came out fine, but it is really stiff (walls need to be a bit thinner). In addition, the hole sagged, so it is very hard to fit a 5mm aluminum wire in. Will need to make the changes in the next iteration!  

## 10/24/2025 - CAD Work  

![Screenshot 2025-10-24 at 10.33.19 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTExNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3ea3dbe514eaec2836ad96286e762eeb1500080e/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20at%2010.33.19%E2%80%AFAM.png)
Made a plethora of updates in CAD
New appearances: 

- Created a mounting system that will use heat set inserts for a modular mount. I aim for this to be compatible with phones, cameras, GoPros etc.
- The Tripod will use 3 legs (circular pattern)
Model updates/revisions:

- Added m5 mounting holes on the "ends" of the legs. This is for potentially mounting the tripod on aluminum extrusion.
- Reduced Wall thickness of TPU sleeve
- Added Chamfers and improved sagging by deleting circular overhangs.
