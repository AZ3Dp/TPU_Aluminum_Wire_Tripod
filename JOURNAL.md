## 10/23/2025 9 AM - Inspiration and Research (and material acquisition)  

![Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 9.32.09 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDc1NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ff1c591ee80d8c00f1057a806c8d19fe36b9dd62/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20at%209.32.09%E2%80%AFAM.png)
I was scrolling through reddit and I came across an inspiring post where the OP used TPU and Aluminum wire. The OP created many cool projects like tripods, helping-hands, and other cool contraptions. The process incorporated pausing the print and embedding aluminum wire in the TPU print. I am thinking of expanding on this idea:

- Create slots so that aluminum wire doesn't need to be added in the middle of a print pause
- Create useful mounts, adaptable and modular
This project seems to have died down on the internet, so I am seeking to bring it back to life!

And I also researched and bought the materials:
95A TPU (already had)
5mm diameter aluminum craft wire
I have all of these supplies, so we should be ready to go!  

## 10/23/2025 2 PM - Created first TPU leg sleeve mockup CAD  

![Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 2.22.13 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDg1NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f4f1f2e17f0178736378765e91ec9dbc6c2a7465/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20at%202.22.13%E2%80%AFPM.png)
In this work session, I created the first version of the TPU leg. It is currently in a very basic form. Essentially, the TPU will form a sleeve around the Aluminum craft wire. I'm not sure if the TPU is too thick - we'll need to print it out to test it!  

## 10/23/2025 4 PM - CAD brush up and slice + first print

Made some small changes to the CAD model: added m3 mounting holes for the soon-to-be tripod. Definitely a nice print. Printed with Prusa Slicer and factory Prusa i3 mk3s+. The TPU came out fine, but it is really stiff (walls need to be a bit thinner). In addition, the hole sagged, so it is very hard to fit a 5mm aluminum wire in. Will need to make the changes in the next iteration!  

## 10/24/2025 - CAD Work  

![Screenshot 2025-10-24 at 10.33.19 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTExNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3ea3dbe514eaec2836ad96286e762eeb1500080e/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20at%2010.33.19%E2%80%AFAM.png)
Made a plethora of updates in CAD
New appearances: 

- Created a mounting system that will use heat set inserts for a modular mount. I aim for this to be compatible with phones, cameras, GoPros etc.
- The Tripod will use 3 legs (circular pattern)
Model updates/revisions:

- Added m5 mounting holes on the "ends" of the legs. This is for potentially mounting the tripod on aluminum extrusion.
- Reduced Wall thickness of TPU sleeve
- Added Chamfers and improved sagging by deleting circular overhangs.  

## 10/25/2025 1 PM - CAD brush up and slice + second print

Today, I 3D printed out the new iteration of the tripod leg made out of TPU. The thinner walls definitely helped with flexibility, but it feels really weak and flimsy. In addition, the aluminum wire (5mm diameter) is having trouble being fully inserted. Will need to improve on this design!  

## 10/25/2025 10 PM - New Leg CAD design  

![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 10.19.58 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYwMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ce16da04fdeac928ea4012fd0c4612f7791a0c32/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2010.19.58%E2%80%AFPM.png)
![Screenshot 2025-10-25 at 10.20.43 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--52b048af89d9edef9bdaa72995603f6bbcccec4f/Screenshot%202025-10-25%20at%2010.20.43%E2%80%AFPM.png)
So a major problem with the previous design was the TPU being both inflexible and flimsy (this would be a tradeoff in a standard design). So, I added these cutouts along the TPU sleeve, which should in theory help with flexibility. This will also allow me to increase the wall thickness, without sacrificing flexibility. I also increased the size of the hole (increased tolerance), as well as optimized the model for 3D printing (horizantal bridges, instead of a circular bridge).
  

## 10/26/2025 - CAD brush up and slice + third print  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTg3NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d24de3b14fb41dc0c5ff71bcc88793181cab6818/image.jpg)
I 3D printed (sliced and printed with Prusa Slicer) the new leg sleeve design, and it’s safe to say that we are one step closer to the final product! The new sleeve is definitely stronger and more flexible than the previous iterations! The only downside I can think of is that the aluminum wire is partly exposed, which depending on your opinion, may be less aesthetically pleasing. I still wasn’t able to get the sleeve onto the wire - I’ll simply increase the tolerance in the next iteration. Super stoked!  

## 10/27/2025 - 3D print failure :(  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjEwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6463cfedb0ed7f0764089734e0649c3460c45cb9/image.jpg)
I made some revisions in CAD and sent it out to print in TPU. Nozzle clogged, probably due to bad filament. Only half of the model came out. I guess I’ll need to spend an hour or so fixing my printer :(  

## 10/30/2025 - It finally works! TPU sleeves fit in alu-wire!  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njg2MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0e138e6da64d92d2c41f356b0f11fdcf4bf2498a/image.jpg)
After a bunch of tweaking in CAD and slicer settings, I finally got the TPU leg sleeve to slide onto the Aluminum craft wire! Now, all I need to do is cut the wire into good lengths and make the camera mount, and we’lol have a final product!
