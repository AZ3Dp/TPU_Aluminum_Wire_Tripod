## 10/23/2025 - Inspiration and Research (and material acquisition)

I was scrolling through reddit and I came across an inspiring post where the OP used TPU and Aluminum wire. The OP created many cool projects like tripods, helping-hands, and other cool contraptions. The process incorporated pausing the print and embedding aluminum wire in the TPU print. I am thinking of expanding on this idea:

- Create slots so that aluminum wire doesn't need to be added in the middle of a print pause
- Create useful mounts, adaptable and modular
This project seems to have died down on the internet, so I am seeking to bring it back to life!

And I also researched and bought the materials:
95A TPU (already had)
5mm diameter aluminum craft wire
I have all of these supplies, so we should be ready to go!
